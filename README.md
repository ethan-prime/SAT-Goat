# SAT Goat Calculator Program
## The SAT Goat app was develop by me for the TI-84 calculator. From what my students have said (I'm an SAT tutor), it's helped them a lot on the Calculator portion of the SAT; and yes, it's allowed!
### Disclaimer: The TI-84 Plus Monochrome version is a bit buggy due to some weird quirks. It still functions, but be wary it may be a bit more buggy and less aesthetically pleasing than the TI-84 Plus CE version. 
# Installation Guide
## Disclaimer: If you are trying to install this on a TI-83 Plus, please visit [this link.](https://github.com/ethan-prime/SAT-Goat/blob/main/83/README.md)
### 1. Download the program below:  
### [For TI-84 Plus CE (COLOR EDITION)](https://github.com/ethan-prime/SAT-Goat-TI84/blob/main/versions/SATGOAT%20(84-CE).8xp?raw=true)
### [For TI-84 Plus (MONOCHROME) and TI-83 Plus](https://github.com/ethan-prime/SAT-Goat-TI84/blob/main/versions/SATGOAT%20(84-MONO).8xp?raw=true)
### 2. Download the TI-Connect CE Software [here.](https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/CA9C74CAD02440A69FDC7189D7E1B6C2/swticonnectcesoftware)

# How to Launch App on Calculator
### Select prgm key on TI-84.
### Make sure you are under the "EXEC" category.
### Select "SATGOAT" app.
### Now click enter to run the program.

# Usage/Examples
# Home: All Categories/Functions
## When you launch the app, you will be prompted with 6 different categories. Select whichever one applies to you, and it will redirect you to a new screen where you will be prompted for further information to be given an answer. Examples of each category can be found further below this section.

# Linear Equations
## Here, you are able to find information about -- you guessed it -- lines! From the menu, select what information you are given about a particular line. Then, an output will be given with useful information about that line which can help you find the correct answer.

# Systems of Equations
## Here, you can solve systems of equations that are in the form:  
### $Ax + By = C$  
### $Dx + Ey = F$

# Factor Polynomials
## Here, you can factor polynomials. It will prompt you for some information of the polynomial such as the highest exponent (degree) and the coefficients. 
## Below are some various factored polynomials.

# Quadratics
## Here, you can find out a lot of information about quadratics, including coverting to vertex form (which happens to randomly appear on the SAT and people, including me, forget how to do it) and to standard form from vertex form (even to both from factored form!). Choose which form of quadratic you are given and follow the prompts and, voila! You now know everything you need to know about that quadratic equation!
